Project Management

## Goals

### Play Nice with Others

This project should be able to be ran side by side with Jira. 

### Simplicity

It's worth noting that the complexity and vastness of features in JIRA can be overwhelming for some users,
especially for smaller teams or for those who prefer a simpler, more straightforward tool.

### Easy and Advanced Search

Do we need something like JQL right off the bat?
Can we get simple search done right?

### Simple and Advanced Reporting

Customizable reports and dashboards?

We should provide easy visibility into project status and team performance.

### Access Control and Security

Simple and secure, ensure that sensitive information is only accessible to the right people.

### API

Integrations will naturally help this grow.

### Kanban and Agile Support

Two biggest types.

### Custom Fields, Workflows, and Issue Types

Can we make these easy and out of the box?

### Integrations

Which of these is most necessary?
Should we focus on Git providers first/only? (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
